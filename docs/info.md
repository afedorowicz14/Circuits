## How it works

Input 2 4-bit words and one 3 bit word on the bidirectional pins in order to generate 6 different functions to use between A and B

0 = +
1 = -
2 = x
3 = /
4 = AND
5 = OR

## How to test

A = 0000-1111
B = 0000-1111
IOU = 000-111

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
